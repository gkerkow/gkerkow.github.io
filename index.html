    <p>
        I am a Field Application Specialist at Biotage, based in San Jose, California, the heart of Silicon Valley and a thriving hub for the biotech industry. In my role, I collaborate with customers to streamline workflows by integrating automated protein and plasmid purification platforms with various liquid handlers. I also specialize in optimizing and developing custom scripts tailored to unique applications of Biotage products for customers around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        My work focuses on providing comprehensive technical support to customers throughout the sales process, from pre-sales consultations to post-sales optimization. I develop product applications backed by lab-generated data, which I analyze and present through technical trainings, white papers, webinars, and conference posters. My ability to clearly communicate complex technical concepts in an accessible way—whether in writing or in live presentations—has been a key factor in my success.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an extrovert, I thrive on building connections, attending conferences, and engaging with customers to understand how our products integrate into their specific workflows. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between technical innovation and real-world application.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering with a minor in Psychology from Louisiana State University. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Biotechnology at San Jose State University, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
